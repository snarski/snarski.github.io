When an unbiased estimator achieves this lower bound, there is usually not much one can do to &amp;ldquo;improve&amp;rdquo; the estimator. Broadly speaking, maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) achieve this lower bound1, and the MLE in free energy calculations is sometimes called Multi-State Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR)2345. It is widely accepted that the ideal setting to obtain the lowest possible variance estimate of a free energy difference is to obtain independent samples from a target mixture distribution and use MBAR to process the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
